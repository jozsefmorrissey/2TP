    "Modular Key Inheritance": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  Inheritance that can be restricted to a given section of html. This is mainly to increase the utility for non technical works.\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;b&gt;For instance:&lt;/b&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  Say you wanted to create a hyper-page on economics. You would need a section on Kaynes and Hayek. You would want the keys from \n  both pages but only over thier respective sections.\n&lt;/p&gt;</pre>",

    "Multiple global Key Inheritance": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  Allowing a page to inherit keys from multiple sources. Multi inheritance can be confusing but I believe the benifit\n  out-weighs the costs here.   \n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;b&gt;For example:&lt;/b&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n  If you want to put a piece of code in your page that uses angular, and jquery. It might be good to include angularjs, \n  jquery, and even programming.basics keywords. The result could be literally every word has a link or definition,\n  helping readers of any skill level.\n&lt;/p&gt; </pre>",
    "Syntax Highlighting": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  Syntax highlighting is a must if this application is to be successful. An important advantage, of this app, is modifying \n  content in real time in the web browser and it is suffering because plan text makes html, css, and json more difficult.\n&lt;/p&gt;</pre>",
    "Html and Css text autofill": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  I think it is safe to say that one of the inspirations for this application was the in browser dev \n  tools. The css auto fill functionality is extremely useful and it needs to be a part of this \n  application. Might as well also add json and html auto-fill.\n&lt;/p&gt;</pre>",
    "Html validation": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  Html Validation is important because:</pre><ul><li>Poorly writing html could disable the interface and make a hyper-page unusable</li><li>Html has no standards because of browser magic fixes.

    "Helpful Json . Html error messages": "<pre>&lt;p&gt;\n  I think this interface could go a long way to introducing people to markup and programming \n  concepts. If useful error messages can be incorperated it will drastically increase the user \n  base.\n&lt;/p&gt;</pre>",
